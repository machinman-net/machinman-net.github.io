<p>
Not doing so usually results in diseases, starvation, 
wars or whatever. Even if our technological tools may postpone part 
of theses scourges, durably breaking equilibrium make unavoidable a 
bigger crisis. Earth is bounded, so are the available resources. So  
must, and will, 
remain the amount of human on Earth.</p>

The very simplified predation model
 lynx-rabbit is enough to figure how misleading can be the real 
situation. Even very 
simple this predator-pray model (1) 
yet exhibit complex behavior that correspond to a non-linear 
differential 
equation when predicting respective population. Such system have two 
stable solutions. One is the pray extinct followed by its predator. The
 other stable solution is hopefully less catastrophic, but is never 
reached as the system tend to oscillate around it.</p>
<p>
In our case, we already hunted many preys <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_extinction">pushing them to extinct</a>. In most case 
extinction happens as an indirect cause of human activities, like 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_pesticides">agriculture</a> (2, 3). But in the oceans, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfishing">overfishing</a> is the direct cause of 
fish depletion. Since 1970, we have lost half of the fishes stocks and 
many species are near extinct 
(4).</p>

<h3><a name="in_2015_7.3b"></a>In 2015 we are 7.3 billion and we yet see the effects of this pressure </h3>

enough scientific work that show the effects of that pressure at global 
level. Have we crossed the red line ? It is to every one to figure and
 make its choice<span id="result_box" class="short_text" lang="en"><span class="hps"></span></span>. In any case, continuous increasing world population will soon give the response.</p>
<p>
Predation pressure comes from two main factor : number of 
people time individual consumption. </p>
<p>
As we don't want to reduce our 
standard of living, that leave no other option but reduce the amount of
 people. Whatever ecologic solution will be find to satisfy our needs, it will never be 
enough to satisfy the needs required by an increasing population, 
expecting their standard of leaving to increase. Indeed, most effects 
observed, now, result from the activity of a small fraction of the 
world, in a small fraction of time. This fraction has grown, and is now also 
efficiently contributing to humanity's ruin.</p>
<p>
According to simple linear forecast for 2100 world population gives some
 16 billion of people on earth. For 150 000 years, most of the time, population was 
constrained by resources but during the last 200 years we improved our 
ability to get what we 
need. Since population blows. As a result, instead of enjoying the 
benefits of progress most of 
human still stay stuck with survival.</p>

<h3><a name="decrease_as_sol"></a>Decreasing population solve a part of our concerns</h3>
<p>
Decreasing population solves a lot of our concerns, unemployment, 
poverty, pollution, over exploitation, epidemics, traffic
 jams, wars which are more or less fed by overcrowding. As a result a 
good part of effort 
is spoiled in trying
 to find how to cope with human increasing population, including, 
economy, technology, political organization, ecology and so on.</p>
<p>
Where is the need to produce more vegetable ? More meat ? The tribe has a
 new comer ! Why should we need a sewer : there is so much of our shit 
around ... Now it like "we have enough food for everybody ! The point is
 to move it where is the need". Let's make some roads and also telecoms 
to take orders.". That is why you need a nuclear power plant. Its 
greenhouse ...</p>
<p>
On the other hand, as shown by china with the one child policy, 
decreasing too fast has its drawbacks. The main one "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-2-1_phenomenon">4-2-1 phenomenon</a>" 
where a single have to handle his 2 parents and 4 grand-parents. This is
 the heavy heritage we have to pay if we want our children to live 
better than us. There are actually many reasons to fall in this two 
stage Ponzi scheme (<a href="#parent_on_kids">1</a>, <a href="#social_ponzi">2</a>) combined with a tragedy of the commons (<a href="#kids_commons">3</a>). Way 
out the other side is difficult.</p>
<p>
From the economic point of view the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-2-1_phenomenon">4-2-1 phenomenon</a>", is to be tempered
 by the level of productivity human has achieved. For sure Artistic sector, for example may suffer, but 
there is no reason to fear about, as there are many people underemployed
 or employed in non vital activities : golf, poker, drug, boxing 
and many more we can lower before starving. Technology and liberal 
economy make us very efficient, it is very 
unlikely we fail just because of hands shortcut.</p>
<p>
There is no special link between GDP per capita and population size. Nor
 Japan nor Europa seems to suffer any harm having rapid or smooth 
degrowth. It is true we have very little experience in this direction. 
Houses are already built, if population decrease there is no need for 
new ones.</p>
<p>
&nbsp; <a name="parent_on_kids"></a>1 The first come from parent relying on kids when old.<br>
&nbsp; <a name="social_ponzi"></a>2 "<a href="http://www.theglobalist.com/is-population-growth-a-ponzi-scheme/" target="_blank">Among its primary tactics, Ponzi demography exploits the fear of 
population decline and aging. Without a young and growing population, we
 are forewarned of becoming a nation facing financial ruin and a loss of
 national power</a>". <br>

ponzi is choking us"

<h3><a name="Target_pop"></a>Target population size </h3>
<p>
As we never address population as a cause and always try to cure the 
consequences, the overall world population is out of control. Have a 
look to the <a href="http://www.unmillenniumproject.org/goals/index.htm" target="_blank">UN Millennium Project</a>:
 not a word on family planning, not a word on sexual eduction, not a 
word on contraception. This summarize  our third world policy. Actually 
most place of the world, especially high income countries, are
 strongly overcrowded. It is the same everywhere: development, growth, 
security and politics are heads of news.</p>
<p>
Even the rare efforts attempted so far in china and India are bashed (<a href="#bash_india_1">1</a>,
 <a href="#bash_india_2">2</a>, <a href="#bash_india_3">3</a>, <a href="#bash_china_4">4</a>, <a href="#bash_china_5">5</a>, <a href="#bash_china_6">6</a>) and opposed with women freedom or retirement concerns. These 
countries make a lot of effort to circumvent their population and have results. Compare <a href="http://populationpyramid.net/bangladesh/2016/" target="_blank">Bangladesh</a> and <a href="http://populationpyramid.net/india/2016/" target="_blank">India</a> age pyramid to <a href="http://populationpyramid.net/pakistan/2016/" target="_blank">Pakistan</a> where family planning is weak. Even not perfect at least they address a real cause.</p>
<p>
The silence around population amount concern is so deep that people actually do not know 
what to think. Most of us would take into account society orientations. So why not just tell us that we do not need babies and 
the reasons for it ?</p>
<p>
Oscillating between optimism and panic does not make a consistent
 policy. It would be better to agree an affordable target population 
that keep margins and try to reach it, without war.</p>
<p>
There are very few publications (<a href="#opt_pop_1">7</a>, <a href="#opt_pop_2">8</a>, <a href="#opt_pop_3">9</a>)
 that try to figure what should be the optimal population. Apart of 
survival we should also question about how much we want to be in a 
hundred year and in a thousand year. What are we gonna do on Mars ? Eden
 garden or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favela">Marsvelas</a> ?</p>

<h3><a name="reason_baby"></a>I beg women to wonder why they want babies</h3>
<p>
We are indeed in the valley of the shadow of death. "All conditioned 
things are impermanent" says Buddha, "The world is afflicted by death 
and decay". Whatever you do its certain your children will suffer, will 
be feared by death and will die.</p>
<p>
Desire, love, sentiment, seduction, family, sexuality all point to a 
single object : children. Even if it is not especially your wish they 
all condemn you to have something growing in your womb that will 
seriously endanger you as your are maintained in chemical camisole.</p>
<p>
We are pushed to do such by a Darwinian selection process that modeled 
our chemical and later our mind for billion years that make the 
procreation process a tremendous drug experiment.</p>
<p>
In front of our parents and ancestors we think we have a debt because we
 would not exist without them having done exactly what they did. 
Disrupting this chain is an insupportable idea and silently act as 
chain letters.</p>
<p>
Having children serve also the need of having somebody that have the 
chance of tacking care of us when old. It is a sort of return on invest 
imposed to our children they have no choice but to do the same, just 
like a Ponzie pyramid.</p>
<p>
Children may also be a way to social position. Whatever kind of improvement
 you expect, it will have its price usually your freedom and sometimes 
it can be as heavy as risking your live or struggling for it and for 
your children for the remaining of it.<p>
