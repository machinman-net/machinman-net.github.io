193. <i>In any event, if in some cases sustainable development were to 
involve new forms of growth, then in other cases, given the insatiable 
and irresponsible growth produced over many decades, we need also to 
think of containing growth by setting some reasonable limits and even 
retracing our steps before it is too late. We know how unsustainable is 
the behaviour of those who constantly consume and destroy, while others 
are not yet able to live in a way worthy of their human dignity. <b>That is
 why the time has come to accept decreased growth in some parts of the 
world, in order to provide resources for other places to experience 
healthy growth. </b>Benedict XVI has said that “technologically advanced 
societies must be prepared to encourage more sober lifestyles, while 
reducing their energy consumption and improving its efficiency”.[135]</i></p>

So be it</p>

<h3><a name="dev_cost"></a>"Development" is very expensive: Extending it worldwide is suicide</h3>
<p>
It is the 
one coming from a place who <a href="http://faculty.history.wisc.edu/archdeacon/404tja/popex.html" target="_blank">use to be and is still overcrowded</a>. The last 
1700 years democratic reorganization followed by the industrial 
revolution has reached the European population raised from 100 million in 1700, 
to 700 million in 2000.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 During this period Europa have heavily contributed to <a href="http://wsl.ch/staff/niklaus.zimmermann/papers/QuatSciRev_Kaplan_2009.pdf" target="_blank">deforestation</a>, species extinction ozone hole and last but not least, global warming. </p>
<p>
Not only the way of development is very costly but also is 
post-industrial model. if it was to be completed by third world it would
enlarge our foot print that is already known to be unaffordable :
 "<a href="http://ourfiniteworld.com/2012/03/12/world-energy-consumption-since-1820-in-charts/" target="_blank">World Energy Consumption Since 1820 in Charts</a>" shows that moving to renewable energy is not for tomorrow. "<a href="http://www.wri.org/blog/2013/12/global-food-challenge-explained-18-graphics" target="_blank">The Global Food Challenge Explained in 18 Graphics</a>" requirement for 2050 population is not about to reduce our foot print.</p>
<p>
Results from efforts toward lowering our impact on planet seems to be 
very small compared to the actual situation. Spreading it everywhere 
will make it worse.</p>

<h3><a name="darwin"></a>Keeping some of us under Darwinian selection is to be considered</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recent_African_origin_of_modern_humans">Man is an endemic species of Africa</a> and thus this place hold the most of functional human genome. Population potential in Africa is tremendously higher than 
everywhere else. In ancient times they have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_human_migrations">colonized the world several 
times</a>. At the time of European colonies some African have been moved to 
replace local population wiped by diseases and bad treatments.
 In spite of really bad living condition, none of these population have 
disappeared. </p>
<p>
On the other hand our medicine allow most people to 
survive but curing us has the statistical long term effect of lowering 
the genome quality. It is possible to fix that with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation#Embryo_selection">test tube baby</a> technologies
 that are available but leaving the faith of humanity in Dr Frankenstein hands is a bit early. Did you heard he created a <a href="http://fish2fork.com/en_GB/news/news/battle-over-gm-salmon-for-human-consumption-rages-on-despite-us-approval" target="_blank">new 
creature mixing salmon with cod</a> ? May be he'd better try concentrate on 
human after all. </p>
<p>
Modern way of live, while reducing mortality <a href="http://wasdarwinwrong.com/korthof97.htm" target="_blank">prevent natural selection 
to act on our genome</a>. <a href="http://www1.wfh.org/publication/files/pdf-1231.pdf" target="_blank">Hemophilia</a>, <a href="http://anthro.palomar.edu/synthetic/synth_4.htm" target="_blank">retinoblastoma</a>,
 are examples where prevalence is significantly higher in high incomes 
countries. This will slowly accumulate deleterious mutations in DNA 
populace lowering 
probability for a man to survive without medical assistance. 
</p>
<p>
These <a href="http://www.onelife.com/evolve/degen.html" target="_blank">worries about human genomic degeneration</a>
 would not exist if at least a part of us stay out modernity and of 
medicine. But as we tend to extend both of them worldwide this will result in
 man endemic African spot to disappear. We may keep part of 
our best human genome within 
Darwinian selection process.
</p>
<h3><a name="pack"></a>Pack to leave half of the planet with low human foot print</h3>
<p>
Are we sure to make our descendant live better, when everywhere will 
be overcrowded, there will be no lion, no rhinoceros, and even no sharks.
 Indeed, development make the world 
incredibly boring as it tend to make everything easier.</p>
<p>
Specie extinction does 
not hit all species equally. While we randomly destroy most species, human parasites 
are positively selected. Mosquitoes, lice, flea, minces, rats, pigeons, 
crows are not about to disappear. Going on pressuring nature mechanically 
select the species that know how to use the new available resource man 
had became.</p>
<p>
It's seems that economy as well as country based policy are both not 
on the right way. First we should recall that overcrowding is always a 
major cause of any trouble. Then solution leading to a population 
increase should be avoided, and so any change must be constrained to 
continuous smooth decrease. Second is that nature does not need our 
help, we are the concern.</p>
<p>
Even a lot of people shares this concerns, we did not yet found many 
ideas
 that solve them. Emptying those places and the means to achieve it may 
look as an extreme ecological dream, but it's a dream and it's better 
than the nightmare we are preparing. It is actually possible if players interests converge. </p>
<p>
From individual point of view there are two options : get in the matrix 
or live in the wild. This choice should be offered at any time to any 
body. It correspond to one of the oldest socialization pattern : in case
 of trouble with the community, go to forest. An other recurrent wish
 is to bring up child in "nature".</p>
<p>
From global view, wasteland should be more than half of the Earth 
including oceans. Southern hemisphere is less populated and have less 
emerged lands, it is also less 
spoiled. On the contrary north have already many 
infrastructure and industrial settlement. Some of them require 
heavy&nbsp; end of live process : nuclear power plants, dams. Border of 
wasteland should correspond more or less to the tropic of Cancer.</p>
  
<h3><a name="policy"></a>Low human interaction oppose to universal  development policy</h3>
<p>
When questioned about poverty and social inequity in the world we react
 with our way of doing things better. Here some example of help we 
provide. </p>
<p>
As stated by this
 random chosen organization <a href="http://www.partnersworldwide.org/" target="_blank">Partners Worldwide</a>, "With four
 strategic directions as our compass, we chart a course toward a
 time of jubilee, when all humanity is reconciled with one another in 
partnership with God". "It is intended to change the way people view 
economic development, breaking the long-standing mold of one-way aid and
 charity".</p>
<p>
This notion of one-way aid and charity is explained by <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/sep/08/charitable-giving-country" target="_blank">Charitable giving by country: who is the most generous ? </a>.
 The basic action is to secure food as stated by this average 
organization <a href="http://www.wfp.org/" target="_blank">WFP's</a> 'Food Assistance for Assets' "Programmes can produce 
immediate advantages for a community in terms of food security and 
nutrition".</p>
<p>
Developing agriculture seems to be better than providing food according 
to this article 
"<a href="https://idl-bnc.idrc.ca/dspace/bitstream/10625/23866/1/109562.pdf">Third
 world needs agricultural development, not food aid say scientists</a>", "A 
recurring theme was the need for developing countries to give greater 
emphasis to agriculture and food production in their national policies".</p>
<p>
Unsurprisingly, <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2014/04/health-care-aid-for-developing-countries-boosts-life-expectancy-study-finds.html">Stanford university</a>
 found that "Foreign aid for health care is directly linked to an 
increase in life expectancy and a decrease in child mortality in 
developing countries". For practice "<a href="http://www.aidforafrica.org/member-charities/medical-bridges/" target="_blank">Medical Bridges</a> closes this health care gap by connecting those who have with those who hope".</p>
<p>
The need for infrastructure is pointed by <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/economic-growth-and-trade/infrastructure">USAID</a>
 when noticed&nbsp; that "In many developing countries, basic 
infrastructure - power, water, sanitation, information and 
communications technologies, and roads - is failing, insufficient, or 
non-existent".&nbsp; In this article from <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/adam-smith-international-partner-zone/tackling-poor-infrastructure-developing-countries" target="_blank">The Guardian</a>
 "Tackling poor infrastructure is vital for developing countries", "Adam
 Smith International has produced a practical tool kit for donors to maximize value on infrastructure programmes". </p>
<p>
There are also a lot of initiatives around <a href="http://en.unesco.org/" target="_blank">education</a>, <a href="http://www.moyak.com/papers/third-world-debt-forgiveness.html" target="_blank">debt relief</a>, <a href="http://www.comm.ucsb.edu/faculty/mstohl/failed_states/1998/papers/sorensen.html" target="_blank">democratic transition</a>, <a href="http://newirin.irinnews.org/cop-21-how-can-africa-unlock-climate-funds/" target="_blank">renewable energy</a> and many more. This large offer should meet most third world needs.

<h3><a name="blow"></a>Development result in population blow that increase social pressure.</h3>
<p>
Did it solve poverty concern, did it 
stabilize population, did it lowered injustice, did it improved people's
 lives ? Most of the times effort just introduced concerns 
that did not exists before. See "<a href="http://www.survivalinternational.org/thereyougo" target="_blank">Around the world ‘development’ is robbing tribal people of their land, 
self-sufficiency and pride and leaving them with nothing</a>". </p>
<p>
On the contrary, in Africa, famines in 1900 
to 1910 killed 42 000 persons while during 1990-2000 it was 470 000 (<a href="#famine_20th">1</a>), ten
 time more. In the
 meanwhile African population that was around 100 million in 1900, rose 
close to 1 billion in 2000 (<a href="http://uaps2007.princeton.edu/papers/70296" target="_blank">Long term population dynamics in Africa: A perspective from the urban structure</a>). Unsurprisingly troubles where also multiplied by a factor of ten.</p>
<p>
"<a href="http://tropicalconservationscience.mongabay.com/content/v3/10-03-29_31-44_bamba_et_al.pdf" target="_blank">The
 hypothesis according to which, in forest zone, the change in population
 density leads a change of landscape structure was verified by means of a
 study area situated in the Oriental Province of the Democratic Republic
 of the Congo</a>". Now human pressure is ten time higher.</p>
<p>
In America, things began very sadly as described in 
"<a href="https://books.google.fr/books?id=9iQYSQ9y60MC&amp;hl=en">American Indian Holocaust and Survival</a>",
 page 44&nbsp; 
which gives the long list of diseases we provided them. As most American
 original population have disappeared they have been replaced with a 
mixed of with European, local, and black. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org.%20/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_Latin_America">wikipedia: Ethnic groups in Latin America</a>). Most of are now offered a great alternative there : favelas or rain forest.</p>
<p>
In these two continents flora and fauna is replaced with an 
agriculture that is not even sustainable. It is likely that all these 
place will dry as explain by "<a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024021;jsessionid=EDE634B41AEA64C73ECAD15104FD9EF7.c3.iopscience.cld.iop.org" target="_blank">large-scale agriculture expansion in Amazonia may introduce climate feedbacks that would reduce precipitation</a>". Development process is changing Amazonian luxuriant tropical forest to a Saharian desert.<br>
</p>
<p>
As a result of colonial, then economical exploitation with a drop of 
charity lead two major continents to have fast and constant population 
increase  while staying near survival. This is the ideal 
situation
 for a massive immigration submersion with a cultural collapse. </p>
<p>
If development process go on in those places they will soon be deserts 
while we likely will see uncontrollable flow of people toward north. 
Turning into deserts both Africa and Amazonia in turn will change 
climate. Indeed we cannot afford to lose African and South American continental rain 
forests and it is exactly what we do when promoting development there.</p>

<h3><a name="drop"></a>This time, look for something to drop, not something to add (1). Money ?</h3>
<p>
So far we tried to cure the third world using our 
successful experiences. We forgot that the tools we are using allow also
 population growth we have had step by step co-evolution. Using them everywhere 
obviously produce the same results everywhere, with a slight difference in population ability to understand their drawbacks.</p>
<p>
One of this tool is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_money#Early_usage">money</a>. It was invented to improve our lives as it
 make people have a better collaboration. One of the main is money 
which provides a reference when doing exchanges. It make everybody 
instantaneously crazy and is a cause of a large panel of mental 
disorders : gold fever, high debt, hoarding, pathological gambling, 
workaholism, overspending, financial denial, risk aversion etc.</p>
<p>
As it is tremendously efficient its removal may be suitable with a 
return to natural equilibrium in those places. Unfortunately it cannot 
be withdraw without a lot of suffering and
 deaths. Money disappearance may just be an evidence of economy 
collapse.</p>
<p>
As well as money, most organizational tools, like state, school, 
finance, medias cannot be removed for the same reasons, they will sharply drop the maximum population allowed without.</p>
<p>
Stopping development program as new infrastructure or new technologies that will "help" these people certainly a good bet.
 Redirecting welfare to an other areas as we did many times 
already ? Children bashing and reforestation effort are to be considered prior 
than the others but this will not change the overall trajectory. </p>
<p>
The magic quadrant at the intersection of organization and nature. 
The 
fun is to kill a lion with a riffle from a four wheel drive with clim. 
Just remove all this stuff, it'll be much more fun. Kill a lion should 
indeed be allowed, after a long travel on wooden sailing boot, several 
hundred km walk, help from locals, serious training session with assegai
 to have a chance to do it. No trophies no photos and an 
interminable way back. Volunteers ? </p>
<p>
Be sure that whatever the difficulty and the level is, there will be 
some.
There is absolutely nothing to organize for such a lion hunting to 
become that dangerous. It is just a lower level of organization in 
Africa. </p>
<p>

</p>
<h3><a name="swallow"></a>North welcome south population until it stabilize at a little rate</h3>
<p>Bangladesh, India, Europa, in these places people found convenient to be more 
numerous. The tools we coined for that are amazing : Writing, Astronomy, Money, School, Math and so on. It is very generous 
from us to wish these ideas to be shared by every 
body to be happy, indeed. That's once again demonstrate that we have made the
 choice of helping each other. </p>
<p>
On the other hand, our way cannot be extended worldwide, especially to 
those places that are top ranked in bio-diversity, just because we must keep margins. So the only thing we 
can do is to welcome people that want to share our choices and let those
 who prefer to stay there, out of the game. And the game should be 
closed as population moves. </p>
<p>
At now this is 1.5 billion people to move, minus the little part who 
will stay. Waiting make this amount to increase until a likely 
uncontrollable flow of people from these places we are not prepared for.</p>
<p>
To achieve transfer we need to setup a high throughput integration path 
to welcome immigrant from old and new world. The current path is adult 
immigration that is far from being fast enough  to swallow enough people 
to empty 
significant surfaces. The effort to handle adult adaptation is heavy 
while they are 
bound with the most difficult situation offered by our organizations.
<p> </p>
A most efficient way may be to move children. "<a href="http://www.africaw.com/how-to-adopt-a-child-from-africa-ghana" target="_blank">Adopting
 a child especially from a third world country (like the poor countries 
in sub-Saharan Africa) and giving that child a good place to call a 
home, good education, and a better future, is one of the greatest gifts 
you can ever give</a>". The drawback of the adoption way is the length of the process and only suit orphans situation.</p>
<p>
A more general process may be godparent that take care of the child 
while maintaining parents links. Optimal age for such exchange should be
 around 8 to 12 years old. This way both party share an equitable part 
of children  bring up work load.</p>
