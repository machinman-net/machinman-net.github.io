<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
Preamble<br>
========<br>
<br>
 &nbsp; The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it. &nbsp;By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<br>
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. &nbsp;This<br>
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<br>
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to<br>
using it. &nbsp;(Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<br>
the GNU Library General Public License instead.) &nbsp;You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
 &nbsp; When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price. &nbsp;Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br>
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in<br>
new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
 &nbsp; To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br>
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<br>
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
 &nbsp; For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<br>
you have. &nbsp;You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<br>
source code. &nbsp;And you must show them these terms so they know their<br>
rights.<br>
<br>
 &nbsp; We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,<br>
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<br>
distribute and/or modify the software.<br>
<br>
 &nbsp; Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain<br>
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>
software. &nbsp;If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br>
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<br>
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<br>
authors' reputations.<br>
<br>
 &nbsp; Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>
patents. &nbsp;We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<br>
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<br>
program proprietary. &nbsp;To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<br>
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<br>
<br>
 &nbsp; The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
 &nbsp;0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; under the terms of this General Public License. &nbsp;The "Program",<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; translated into another language. &nbsp;(Hereinafter, translation is<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; included without limitation in the term "modification".) &nbsp;Each<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. &nbsp;The act<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; the Program (independent of having been made by running the<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Program). &nbsp;Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br>
<br>
 &nbsp;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; this License along with the Program.<br>
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; for a fee.<br>
<br>
 &nbsp;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;program under these conditions, and telling the user how to<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;view a copy of this License. &nbsp;(Exception: if the Program<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;itself is interactive but does not normally print such an<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;announcement, your work based on the Program is not required<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to print an announcement.)<br>
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. &nbsp;If<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; works. &nbsp;But when you distribute the same sections as part of a<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br>
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; derivative or collective works based on the Program.<br>
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; other work under the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
 &nbsp;3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; following:<br>
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;source code, which must be distributed under the terms of<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;software interchange; or,<br>
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to distribute corresponding source code. &nbsp;(This alternative is<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;received the program in object code or executable form with<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br>
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; making modifications to it. &nbsp;For an executable work, complete<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; used to control compilation and installation of the executable.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; not include anything that is normally distributed (in either<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.<br>
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
 &nbsp;4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; except as expressly provided under this License. &nbsp;Any attempt<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; License. &nbsp;However, parties who have received copies, or rights,<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
 &nbsp;5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; signed it. &nbsp;However, nothing else grants you permission to modify<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; or distribute the Program or its derivative works. &nbsp;These actions<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.<br>
<br>
 &nbsp;6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; subject to these terms and conditions. &nbsp;You may not impose any<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; granted herein. &nbsp;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; by third parties to this License.<br>
<br>
 &nbsp;7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; License. &nbsp;If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; your obligations under this License and any other pertinent<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Program at all. &nbsp;For example, if a patent license would not permit<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; entirely from distribution of the Program.<br>
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; in other circumstances.<br>
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; implemented by public license practices. &nbsp;Many people have made<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; willing to distribute software through any other system and a<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; licensee cannot impose that choice.<br>
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; to be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
 &nbsp;8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; the original copyright holder who places the Program under this<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; in or among countries not thus excluded. &nbsp;In such case, this<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; this License.<br>
<br>
 &nbsp;9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; versions of the General Public License from time to time. &nbsp;Such<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Each version is given a distinguishing version number. &nbsp;If the<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Program specifies a version number of this License which applies<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; to it and "any later version", you have the option of following<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; version published by the Free Software Foundation. &nbsp;If the Program<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; author to ask for permission. &nbsp;For software which is copyrighted<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. &nbsp;Our decision<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; LAW. &nbsp;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. &nbsp;THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. &nbsp;SHOULD THE<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
=============================================<br>
<br>
 &nbsp; If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these<br>
terms.<br>
<br>
 &nbsp; To do so, attach the following notices to the program. &nbsp;It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND AN IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Copyright (C) 19YY &nbsp;NAME OF AUTHOR<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. &nbsp;See the<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.<br>
<br>
 &nbsp; Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper<br>
mail.<br>
<br>
 &nbsp; If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like<br>
this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
